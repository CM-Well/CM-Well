        Michael, This one is actually working!!! (other two divs below have escaped html, I removed them from this source file)
            See Incognito Chrome Window.
            Why didn't we see any difference? Because AngularJS was caching our dashboard.html... once I open a new Incognito window it was ok
    -->
