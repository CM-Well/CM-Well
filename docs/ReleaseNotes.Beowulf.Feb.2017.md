### Support the '#' Character in Infoton UUIDs ###

**GitLab Item No.:** 324.

**Description:**
CM-Well has been modified to support the '#' character in infoton UUIDs (previously not supported). This character is often used in ontology subjects, so this change comes to facilitate that usage. Both the CM-Well API and the web UI now support this change.

>**Note:** When using the '#' character as part of an infoton UUID, it must be escaped as `%23`.
