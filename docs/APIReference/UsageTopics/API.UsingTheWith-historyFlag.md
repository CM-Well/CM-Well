# Using the with-history Flag

Each time a CM-Well infoton is updated, a "historical" copy of it is saved, and its URL (which serves as a "virtual link") is updated to point to the most recent version.

Each version of the infoton has a "point in time URL", which is a unique URL pointing to that particular version.

For example, this is what we see when retrieving the default (latest) version of an infoton:

![image](../../_Images/Infoton-no-history.png)

And this is what we see when retrieving the same infoton, using the with-history flag:

![image](../../_Images/infoton-with-history.png)

Note that the infoton has 12 historical versions (the image shows only one page of results).
