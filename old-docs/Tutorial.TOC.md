The CM-Well tutorials describe workflows you can perform with the CM-Well API, and provide actual function call examples which you can copy and submit to CM-Well, and response examples which you can compare to the responses you receive.

The following tutorials are provided:

* [Docker tutorial](Tutorial.Docker.md) - a shorter tutorial, intended to be run against a private CM-Well Docker instance.
* [General tutorial](Tutorial.HandsOnExercisesTOC.md) - a longer tutorial with more workflows.
* [Building CM-Well](Tutorial.Building.md) - how to download, compile and run CM-Well

>**Note:** The Docker workflows are included in the General Tutorial. You can use all workflows with any environment, as long as you change the CM-Well host URL to be the platform against which you're working.
