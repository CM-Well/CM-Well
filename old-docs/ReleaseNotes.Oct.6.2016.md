### Markdown Displays in Pretty Mode by Default ###

**Description:**

Markdown content is now displayed with the addition of the "pretty" flag by default. This causes the display to have HTML-like formatting rather than plain text formatting. This behavior was added in order to create a friendlier user experience when reading CM-Well documentation.

**Documentation:** N/A.

----------

### Better Handling of Lengthy bulk-consume Preparation Stage ###

**Description:**

While the overall bulk-consume API provides very fast data streaming, bulk-consume has a preparation ("warm-up") stage that can be long. This could previously result in a long response time for returning the first chunk. Bulk-consume behavior was changed such that if the preparation stage takes more than 8 seconds, the API returns a shorter chunk (as for a call to the **consume** API) for that request, causing it to return faster.

**Documentation:** [Consume Next Bulk](API.Stream.ConsumeNextBulk.md)

### Improved Handling of Large File Infoton Uploads ###

**Description:**

Some customers need to upload large files to CM-Well, for instance when packaging user-defined functions in large jar files, to be called within CM-Well SPARQL queries.

Previously, CM-Well could fail to upload large files, and its storage of such files was less efficient. Both these problems have been solved in this version.

**Documentation:** N/A.
